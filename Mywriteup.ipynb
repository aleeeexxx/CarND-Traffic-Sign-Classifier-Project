    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "Here, I normalized the dataset into the range from 0 to 1, because the lost function should never get too big or too small. We always want our variables to have mean around 0 and equal variance. I didn't convert them to grayscale because colors are meaningful to traffic signs. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",

    "#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I set batch size to 128 and learning rate as 0.001. 20 epochs were done to garantee a high accuracy. Also. RELU was chosen as modofier after the first convolution and the first two fully connected layers to make the model nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "LeNet was choosen since I am familiar with it through the leasson I took previously. It's a 5 layers CNN in which first two layers are convolutioanl and the last three layers are fully connected and finally can output logits. First I used the exactly the same CNN within the leassons by just changing the first input image's color channel from 1 to 3, but the accuracy was remaining low at 0.17 which was even not increasing with the training process. I though it might be an issue of the CNN's architecture, so I modified the structures by largely increased the depth of each layer. However, it didn't solve the problem. Finally, I realized the a mistake at the normalization step, in which I didn't defined a proper data type, casuing all matrices bing 0. A well working model appears right after I correct that type to float32. \n",
    "\n",
    "My model works well as its accurary of validation and test are both higher than 0.93.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 0.941\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 0.941 \n",

    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The forth image might be difficult to classify because it's too vague to  be even recognized by eyes, and the number of the training samples is small with only less than 500 images whcih could leave the model under-trained and thus lead to a failure in the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric).\n",
